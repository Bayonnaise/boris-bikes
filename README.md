## Boris Bikes

In week 3 at Makers Academy we started on OOP, building a Boris Bike rental system using Bike, DockingStation, Van, Garage and Person classes.

Version 1:
First we used the Chicago style, using RSpec tests that required other classes in order to function.

Version 2:
Once that was complete we went back and rebuilt the system using London style testing, making each spec file self-contained through the use of doubles.
